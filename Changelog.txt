	* Added: Fame system (SQL). Imported from jA and modified to be based on sql table, rather than global registers [Proximus]
		- SQL loading of Top10 fame list is done by the char-server and sent to the map-server when this request it.
			The map-server only requests the Top10 list at start and its saved locally (cache), to avoid requesting
			the char-server for a fresh list everytime the ranking list is modified. (map_is_alone)
		- On multimap servers: the sorting and updating of fame list is done by the char-server, therefore map-server will have to
			request a fresh top10 fame list to char-server everytime ranking list is modified.
		- Alchemist fame system: An alchemist will earn points by making slim potions (condensed). From 1 to 50 points, 
			according the number of potions made in a row without failing once. The success counter is resetted everytime it fails.
			Alchemist potions from the top10 fame list will have +50% effectiveness.
			Command to display the top10 alchemist: /alchemist.
		- Blacksmith fame system: A blacksmith will earn points by forging weapons or refining them to +10. From 10 to 1000 points.
			Blacksmith that has forged level 3 weapon with 3 ingredients will be rewarded with 10 points. 
			As it can also be rewarded for refining forged weapon to +10: 1 point as a reward for refining a level 1 weapon, 
			25 points reward for refining a level 2 weapon, 1000 points reward for refining a level 3 weapon.
			Forged weapons from the top10 blacksmith will receive an additional absolute damage of 10 (pierces vit/armor def).
			Command to display the top10 blacksmith: /blacksmith.
