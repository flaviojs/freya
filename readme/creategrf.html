<p><h2 class="header">How to: Create GRFs for your Server<br />
by Jodaho</h2></p>


<p>I'm often asked, what is a .GRF file, and why do I want one for my server?</p>
<p>Well, what a .GRF basically is, is sort of a compact data folder. Why would I want one? Some reasons are to deter botters, and space wise.
With a data folder, it can take a lot of room on your computer, but with a .GRF it can lower it a lot.
Also, unless botters know how to extract .GRF's it makes it harder to get your servers IP, when with a data folder its right there in your sclientinfo.xml.
Also, .GRFs can be updated with patch files such as .GPF's with RO Loader.</p>

<p>1. The first thing you'll need to do is download these files:<br /><br />

Gay Convert here:<br />
<a href="http://eamirror.skamfroj.net/xdl/download.php?id=107">http://eamirror.skamfroj.net/xdl/download.php?id=107</a><br /><br />
And GRF Factory here:<br />
<a href="http://www.shadowro.net/tsuyuki/Tools/GRF%20Factory%200.6c%20-%20TimeCop.rar">http://www.shadowro.net/tsuyuki/Tools/GRF%20Factory%200.6c%20-%20TimeCop.rar</a></p>
<p>You can extract those files with <a href="http://www.rarlabs.com">WinRAR</a></p>

<p>2. Take the data folder that you want to turn into a .GRF, right click on it, select Copy, then head into the same folder as you installed Gay Convert, and right click and select Paste to bring the data folder right by gayconv.exe</p>

<p>3. Run gayconv.exe and after it's completed, your data folder instead of being in messed up letters (ASCII) should now be in Korea.
If it isn't, and it just has little squares, that means you need to install Korean fonts on your PC before you can continue.
If it says "cannot cd into the dir" then use the solution at the bottom of the post.</p>

<p>4. Head to where you installed GRF Factory and run GRF Factory.exe</p>

<p>5. Click the Add Dir button and choose the Korean data folder.
Then after its loaded on, click Repack and name your GRF something like yourservernamehere.grf
(In the choose file name box don't just write yourservernamehere and expect it to add the .grf on the end, you have to actually type yourservernamehere.grf)</p>

<p>6. Now, in your Korean data folder directory there should be a file called yourservernamehere.grf</p>

<p>7. You now have to configure the DATA.ini. Open it up in your RO folder and it should look something like this:</p>
<p><span style='color:green'>0=adata.grf<br />
1=sdata.grf<br />
2=data.grf</span></p>

<p>8. Now, edit the DATA.ini to read like this:</p>
<p><span style='color:green'>0=yourservernamehere.grf<br />
1=adata.grf<br />
2=sdata.grf<br />
3=data.grf</span></p>

<p>9. Now, make sure the client you're using reads the .GRF first. You can also edit the DATA.ini to read many .GRFs so it could be like:</p>
<p><span style='color:green'>0=yourservernamehere.grf<br />
1=adata.grf<br />
2=sdata.grf<br />
3=data.grf<br />
4=yourserversmapshere.grf</span></p>

<p>10. You're all set to go. Just release the DATA.ini and yourservernamehere.grf to your players and they're ready to go.</p>

<p>Any questions? Just ask.</p>

<h2 class="header">F.A.Q.'s</h2>
<p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>:I get the error "can't cd into the dir" when I try to translate from ASCII to Korean.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Use this alternative method:<br />
1. Download Unbollox here: <a href="http://www.shadowro.net/tsuyuki/Server%20Files/Tools/Unbollox%202k4%20-%20StelTechCor.rar">http://www.shadowro.net/tsuyuki/Server%20Files/Tools/Unbollox%202k4%20-%20StelTechCor.rar</a><br />
2. Open it and write in the path to your data folder at the top with back slashes (Not forward slashes, so C:/data would be wrong but C:\data would be right)<br />
3. Click the button with the Korean text at the bottom left hand corner (Not the one with the weird ASCII letters.
 If the box next to it has squares in it then you need to install Korean fonts on your computer.
 If not, it will have Korean text in it. Click that button and wait for Unbolloxiser to do its stuff.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: I get some error code 2 with GRF Factory.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Check to see if every file in your data folder is Korean and that none are left ASCII.<br />
4. Now, everything should be translated and you can continue at step 6.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: How do I install Korean fonts on my computer?<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: In order to install Korean fonts you must open up your Internet Explorer.
 Click View at the top then Encoding in the menu. Select More in the menu that pops up.
 There should be a list of languages and one of them should be Korean. It'll bring up a box, on the box click the Install button.
 Then, just follow the onscreen prompts.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: Can I use another software (GRF Factory)?<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: You can... my guide is for GRF Factory, take it elsewhere.<br />
 (from [dshome]): You can also use the gryff from <a href="http://gryff.clownphobia.com/">http://gryff.clownphobia.com/</a> to create .grf files. This is better than GRF Factory.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: I have Windows 98. I extract all data files... but i cant pack it again. Why?<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: All programs say windows 2000 and up. Then sorry, you'll have to upgrade.<br />
