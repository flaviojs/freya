// Spawn/Summon/grind2/deadbranch limitation file (mob_deny.txt) - A Freya file created by Yor.
//
// This file is used to limit spawn and summon with GM commands.
//
// Format 1 (nobody can spawn the mob):
// [mob_id]
// Format 2 (GM with a minimum level can spawn the mobs):
// [mob_id],[minimum_level_to_spawn]
// Examples:
// 1002,80   would result in limiting spawning of porings to GM level 80 or higher (lol)
// 1007      would result nobody can spawn a fabre
//
// Set here a minimal gm level for spawning specific mobs.
