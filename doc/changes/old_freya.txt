	                   Even when under the effect of this skill, if the enemy takes the damage,
	                   they will take the damage + and be poisoned if they weren't already. It now takes 1 Red Gemstone every cast.

	                So to clarify once again, at LV 5, you only receive total of INT + 3 bonus, not all combined.
	 - Summon Flora: Bio Cannibalize: Summons a plant-type monster that attacks enemies you are attacking (skill.c).
	                 This summoned monster will disappear eventually, and maximum HP will be different based on the skill level.
	                 You cannot summon another one while having one already spawned.
	                 Lasting time has also been significantly reduced to 1 minute at LV 5.
	                 Monsters that are spawned are different based on the skill level, and they are as follows:
	                 * LV 1: 5 Mandragoras
	                 * LV 2: 4 Hydras
	                 * LV 3: 3 Floras

	  *not* update the "atcommand.c" file while I'm doing that sicne I
